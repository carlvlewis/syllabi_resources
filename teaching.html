<h2>Motivation to teach</h2>

<p>My first management role out of graduate school inspired me to teach. As a fresh-faced, 23-year-old digital content manager inheriting three employees who were all well older than I was, the responsibility of assuming leadership felt at first intimidating. But, it didn’t take long before I realized I had my own digital knowledge and skills I could teach the team, and that by employing those skills myself I could set an example for them to follow. I challenged my employees to experiment with new forms of storytelling, and to break from traditional tasks to employ a new, more user-centric method to content creation, often of their own choosing.</p>

<p>Most effectively, I acted with such nerdy and genuine excitement at our work — without shame or fear of appearing to my team as ‘uncool’ — and that excitement became contagious. When one employee who was particularly talented and motivated expressed fear of wrangling with a particularly difficult snippet of code, I reaffirmed my belief in her problem-solving skills, while also putting the programming task at hand in simpler terms she would understand (i.e. “HTML is the structure; CSS is the style”). I’ll never forget the look of wonder and intrigue that came across her face when she finally finished building her first web app. It wasn’t long after that when I decided my best way to serve the profession was to teach.</p>

<h2>Why Hofstra?</h2>

<p>On a sentimental level, Hofstra reminds me a great deal of my own undergraduate institution in Georgia, <a href="http://mercer.edu">Mercer University</a>, except that the Lawrence School’s student participation and multimedia facilities far surpass the media curriculum I had when I attended undergraduate. While Hofstra’s School of Communications has already received top honors for successful post-graduation outcomes, I believe – in fact, assisting in the task myself would be inherent in my mission as an assistant professor – that an even deeper potential lies just beneath the surface of the Lawrence School, and that — by converging the school’s communications mediums and disciplines more tightly - and focusing more intensely on entrepreneurial and computational journalism for M.A. students, that Hofstra, with its range of communications programs and massive facility, can outshine even the traditionally strongest journalism education programs in the country.</p>

<h2>Approach to teaching</h2>

<p>My approach to teaching involves three general steps: (a) getting the student not just interested in, but <em>excited about</em> the subject matter, (b) instilling confidence in the student while patiently offering assistance as needed and (c) allowing the student to shape the end product of work in an experiential <em>and</em> experimental learning environment.</p>

<p>Piquing student interest and participation – the first and most difficult of those three hurdles – can initially prove difficult, especially if the student isn’t already familiar with the topic at hand. Like any good journalist, this is when I try to simplify the subject matter into terms and metaphors that a general audience would understand (i.e. “an iFrame is sort of like a window into another webpage”). I bring high energy and excitement to the classroom, with the goal of spreading my enthusiasm for learning to the rest of the class. </p>

<p>Positive feedback and confidence-boosting skill-based compliments help foster this enthusiasm and ease the student into the task of learning for herself. Negative opinions regarding good-faith student work should <em>never</em> be verbalized publicly in front of the student’s peers. I find it instead much more valuable for the entire group for the class to critique each other’s work, as it puts the entire class to task at critically examining what makes good work and what doesn’t.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire teaching process, I try to <em>think like a student</em>. Most of all, I remain a good student myself: constantly learning new technologies and honing my craft, refining my research and connecting it to my teaching to make the classroom an exciting place to be.</p>

<h2>Open-Source Learning and Hacking the News</h2>

<p>I believe that all student work that comes out of communications schools should be shared and open-sourced among the broader community and media industry, usually via <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. I also believe students should become familiar with open-source best-practices by the time they finish a journalism undergraduate program, and that students <em>should</em> receive bylines/credit for real-world applicable work with URLs and Github repositories to show prospective employers. Furthermore, I believe that my duty as an educator requires me to open-source all teaching materials, syllabi, etc. that I compile for teaching — not only for posterity but more saliently the benefit of other educators. Mitch Resnick of MIT’s Media Lab has proposed a similar learning model that he calls <a href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/howard-rheingold/mitch-resnick-role-making-tinkering-remixing-next-generation-learning">“creative learning”</a>. Such a learning style requires four main components, as I see it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn by <em>making</em> new things</li>
<li>Make <em>real</em> things that matter</li>
<li>Do it with other people (or at least with others nearby)</li>
<li>Share the new things you make with the rest of the web.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, the process of open-sourcing can just mean uploading a multimedia project to YouTube or curating a Pinterest group board like <a href="http://pinterest.com/carlvlewis/dataviztools">this one I curate</a> – so long as the methodology behind the work is clear or explained in detail. While the end goal of any journalism course should ideally be to produce publishable work, I personally do not think a journalism educator should act to a student as an editor would to a reporter. The purpose of the student’s time in school is above all else to <strong>learn</strong> the importance, the ethics, the art <em>and</em> the science of the craft of media and communications. Thus, my major goal in the classroom is to act not just as a lecturer speaking from a pedestal of one-to-many; it is to serve as a collaborator, helping individual students on problems they may encounter and going through technical processes myself with students as they along with my work. </p>

<p>Particularly when more complex technologies become involved (<em>think: upper-level computational journalism seminar</em>), the time it can take for a student to grasp even the basic daily lesson can vary greatly from student to student. Getting the development environment set up alone can be unnecessarily tedious at times, requiring a high level of programmatic knowledge and programming jargon and, in turn, acting as an artificially high barrier to entry for many students. (<em>Those in the industry who claim to want to bring greater diversity to the programming community should consider addressing this.</em>) Having said that, I want to clarify that technologies alone does not constitute journalism. Coding, design, mathematical and computing skills are simply a few of many means of getting to the story.</p>

<h2>On Publication-Ready Coursework</h2>

<p>Deadline-driven production of accurate, insightful and timely journalistic product is no doubt an important skill to master in preparation for the professional job market. Nonetheless, for educational purposes (and, arguably, for professional success, too), quality (often learned first by failures) trumps quantity. I find that by enforcing a rigid teaching-hospital adherence to obscure, often print-centric deadlines for content creation more often than not stifles the very sort of creative and entrepreneurial approaches to interactive storytelling that students need to learn now more than ever – not just for their own careers but for the future of mediated journalism itself.</p>

<h2>On Journalism Educational Pedagogy</h2>

<p>Having first started working as a traditional beat reporter at my hometown daily newspaper in the mid–2000s, I’ll readily admit my naïveté and myopia regarding the changes that would soon rattle the industry. In my 17-year-old self-conception, I would one day be a noble and prolific <em>newspaper</em> reporter, racing against the daily print deadline and shoveling text online as an afterthought. Paradoxically, however, I consumed almost all my news online even then, and little of my media diet constituted the sort of “serious” journalism I saw myself doing as a professional in the future. I trolled blogs about American Idol and indie rock bands, NBC sitcoms and emerging technology trends. <em>My RSS feed contained very few legacy media organizations.</em> So why did I aspire so much to be a newspaper reporter? </p>

<p>I’m of the firm belief that I am among the older bracket of a two-generation crop of young journalists who came of age during the transition between two radically different eras of media consumption. One conception came to them from learned experience of what “professional journalism” had traditionally been; the other was rapidly unfolding without many even noticing. </p>

<p>Luckily, I had parents and professors who helped me find the middle-ground between the surface-level, GIF-filled listicles and “the serious stuff,” and I made a deliberate effort to understand the underlying business disruptions and innovations transforming the journalism industry from the ground up and causing these changes. While fellow graduate students in 2011 balked at <em>The Huffington Post</em> and <em>Buzzfeed</em> as cheap gossip and curation sites that lacked prestige and ranked well beneath their skill level, I took a more quantitative approach to the issue. <em>Buzzfeed</em>, for example, was developing experimental, entrepreneurial revenue streams and content strategies to support its journalistic work, hiring new staffers in droves even as legacy, venerable news institutions suffered continued furloughs, buyouts and layoffs in an effort to adjust to the new normal. (today, those same peers clamor for jobs at Mashable, Buzzfeed, Vice, et. al. often more aggressively than they do for <em>The New York Times.</em>)</p>

<p>Hence ––&nbsp;as I intend to outline in more detail with actual research in the future –– I am leery of the *“teaching hospital” * model of journalism education championed by philanthropic journalism funders, educational institutions and universities alike. The teaching hospital model of educating journalists very well could work, and it may indeed do so, but from my experience it has more frequently restricted academia to the imperatives of legacy production workflows, often soloed by medium. The role of the journalism school is, no doubt, to teach by doing; however, currently-vogue “teaching hospital” models run the risk of leaving less bandwidth for the level of innovation, entrepreneurship, agility and research that is crucial for journalism’s future. </p>

<h2>Service-Learning/Experiential Learning Modules</h2>

<p>In a transitional flux in which even the most committed, devoted journalists often today find themselves doubting the very real importance of their work to the public or publics they purport to serve, I believe it’s pivotal that all pedagogical classroom lessons and readings coincide with real-world experiences that give deeper meaning to the subject matter at hand. Whether it means covering a local topic of little previous public scrutiny for an entire semester or creating multimedia projects/mobile web apps that document a situation or cause in the surrounding campus community, I believe that serving others <em>directly</em> through the work produced in the classroom is a crucial component to a holistic media education (*see: JMS 262, a course in which I led students to build an interactive guide to local hidden gems). Helping those around you instills pride in one’s self. Pride in one’s self instills a sense of purpose. A sense of purpose empowers a stronger desire for learning to become a media professional –– a hunger that translates ultimately into academic and career excellence.</p>
