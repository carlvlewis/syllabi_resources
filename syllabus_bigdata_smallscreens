## I.  Rationale

Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information––a phenomena  referred to by scholars as the rise of “Big Data.” With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes and interactive web apps, we allow users to understand the stories those numbers hide. At the same time, however, the majority of users worldwide now access the web via mobile devices with smaller screen sizes that can complicate the task of creating clear, usable and truthful data visualizations by forcing us to squeeze large amounts of data into limited screen real-estate. Developing theoretical models –– and possibly even practical solutions to –– this challenge of displaying Big Data on small screens will, thus, be an underlying principle throughout this course as we learn the history, theory, guidelines  and technical practice/workflow of data journalism.

## II. Overview and Goals

This four-credit hour lecture and lab course will first analyze the historical, theoretical, statistical and ethical principles behind the nascent field of data-driven journalism, then impart basic-to-intermediate technical skill-sets needed to tell data-driven stories visually and interactively on all screen sizes and devices. Technologies and tutorials will for the most part take place during Monday's lab-time, while analysis and discussion will take place primarily during the three hours of lecture time each week.

Part graphic design, part basic statistics, part computer science, part data science and part shoe-leather reporting, students should leave this course with a thorough grasp of both the *process* and the *product* of obtaining, processing, analyzing and visualizing massive datasets and spreadsheets to convey an accurate and cohesive visual narrative to a non-professional audience on both large and small screen sizes. 

## III Technologies and Tools Covered

While data journalism technologies will inevitably evolve and change with time, the course will – for purposes of experience and workflow – cover the real-world application of current “Web 2.0” responsive data visualization technologies and standards. These conventions include the basic building blocks of a modern native web app –– HTML, CSS and JavaScript –– as well as the most commonly used data storage formats in currency today: CSV (comma-separated-value files) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). If any or all of these terms sound scary or foreign to you at the start of the course, **do not fear:** You will not be expected to leave this course as a JavaScript engineer, nor a data scientist, nor a web developer. But you will be expected to carry out simple, guided in-class assignments that will help you to begin to understand how these various technologies appear in text (or, more precisely, code) and how they interact together to render a web page in the modern browser. **In addition, if you at any point feel like you  need extra help understanding *any* concept or technology outside of class, you are encouraged to schedule one-on-one instruction time with me using the schedule reservation booking page at the beginning of this syllabus. Please allow 24 hours before an upcoming deadline to schedule a meeting to ensure you leave adequate time for us to meet. **
 
For data journalism *production* purposes, we'll primarily be employing a number of open-source tools and libraries that require little-to-no coding knowledge, and instead focus the bulk of our efforts more upon data sourcing, processing, analysis, design and presentation. *That said, we will still be conducting regular exercises and assignments that introduce basic programming concepts and practices*, as graphical tools cannot in all cases do all the heavy lifting for us. The more complex the dataset, the higher the likelihood some coding may be needed.

## IV.  Course Materials

Each class will include different assigned readings from mostly free online sources (blog posts, essays, open-source e-books or excerpts from other sources) made available for download at least three (3) weeks in advance of each class on the course website listed above. That said,  three (3) full textbooks will be required for purchase or loan for the duration of the course: 

1. Cairo, Alberto. *The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization. *Berkeley, CA :New Riders, 2013. Print.
2. Hinderman, Bill. *Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web.* Indianapolis, IN: Wiley, 2016. Print.
3. Mollerup, Per. *Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections*. Bloomsbury, 2015. Print.

In addition, students will be expected to download and have on-hand the full-text of *The Data Journalism Handbook: How Journalists Can Use Numbers to Improve the News *from O'Reilly Press (available for free download at [datajournalismhandbook.com](http://datajournalismhandbook.com/)). We will also read excerpts from a number of other books on the subjects of information design and data journalism, which are listed at the end of the syllabus and which I will provide for you.

No specific prerequisite courses nor any prior programming knowledge is necessary to take this course. While the subject matter may seem complex or daunting at first, I assure you that, with a little enthusiasm and self-belief coupled with sincere effort, you will eventually have that “Aha!” moment and get it. Trust me, it's not rocket science, but I'm pretty sure it can be just as rewarding as rocket science if you come into class open-minded and ready to learn. 

All software used will be freeware or open-source licensed, with the exception of Microsoft Excel, which is available on lab computers in the event you do not own a copy yourself.

## V. Course Deliverables and Projects

No exams or quizzes will be administered as a part of this course. Your grade hinges entirely upon the quality of the data journalism you produce, the intellectual rigor of your critiques and reading responses, and the level of participation you demonstrate by offering meaningful class discussion.

Successful students will:

* Offer one (1) thoughtful, well-articulated design, data or interaction critique of a popular and/or novel example of data journalism of your choice each week in the form of a blog post published no later than 8 a.m. the morning before each Monday class. Each Monday at the start of class, two students will be chosen beforehand based upon the quality of their blog posts to present their critiques and findings briefly to the class **(critiques account for 10% of course grade).**
*  Reflect critically upon assigned readings for each class, and compose one (1) blog post on each assigned reading no later than 8 a.m.  the morning before each class **(reading responses account for 20% of course grade)**.
* Follow along with in-class/lab programming, data analysis, statistical and visualization tutorials and submit finished work from each tutorial via email no later than the start of the next class meeting. Tutorials will be paced in a manner that you should reasonably be able to complete them in-class. They will also be a available as screencasts uploaded to the class website for later review. But, if you still encounter difficulty, I encourage you to schedule time to meet with me outside of class for further assistance **(guided lab tutorial results submissions account for 10% of course grade)**.
* Produce a total of three (3) individual 'deadline' data journalism/data visualization projects that might be reasonably produced in 1-2 days of full-time work on a topic of current interest. Projects may take the form of an interactive chart, map, dashboard, data-driven game/animation or other visualization, and should include any necessary explanatory text or reporting to compliment the visualization. The projects will be evaluated on both technique and the strength of the underlying data and the story being told **(deadline data journalism projects cumulatively account for 20% of final grade; thus, if you do poorly on your first project and then exceedingly well on your second and third, you could still *in theory* receive a high score overall in this category)**.
* Participate meaningfully in class discussions on peer critiques and assigned readings and — to a lesser extent -- during lab tutorials. This does not mean participation for the sake of participation. This means offering insightful, unique, critical analysis of the text and subject at hand that contributes and furthers discussion, or raises otherwise new insights. You will be given written feedback from me regarding your performance in this aspect of the course three times during the semester: once at week six (6), again at week twelve (12), then once again two (2) weeks prior to the end of term **(participation accounts for 20% of final course grade**).
*  By the end of the course, you should be able to contribute meaningfully to a final group project that takes the form of a data-driven news application that allows for dynamic data exploration among multiple hierarchies of information and responds appropriately to a range of screen sizes . Accompanying the visual(s) may or may not be a textual. image-based and/or video narrative describing the effects and providing human voices to the story conveyed by the data. You may here also cite anecdotal evidence such as original reporting, including remarks from individuals who  specialize in the topic of your project. This project will be presented in front of a panel of well-known data and visual journalists a week prior to its final due date (Dec. 14), and judges will offer feedback on ways you might improve your project before it is officially submitted to the instructor via email **(final group project accounts for 20% of course grade)**.

### Redo policY: 

Given that data visualization is an inherently visual specialization and often best critiqued by redesign, you will each get one chance to redesign or “redo” any single one (1) of the three (3) deadline data journalism projects if you are unhappy with your score. This effectively allows you to use the feedback given to you from me to improve the visualization and/or journalistic strength of your original project and submit it again for re-evaluation within ten (10) days of the date the project score and feedback was returned to you. You also will receive one (1) free pass to use if you fail to submit a critique/reading before deadline. With this pass, as long as you make up the post within one week of the due date, you will not be penalized for the late submission.  

Final course grades will be determined using the standard academic format rounding to the nearest integer: A=90-100%, B+=85-89%, B=80-84%, C+=75=79%, C=70-74%, D=60-70% and <60%=F.

*As the course components above suggest, this course aims to blend theory/discussion equally with practice and production of actual data journalism. Producing stellar works of data journalism but failing to post reading responses and critiques at an acceptable level will **not** be sufficient to succeed in this course. Likewise, diligent blog posts and participation without a sincere attempt to put theory into practice with actual data journalism projects will also **not** meet criteria for course success.*

## VI. Attendance Policy and Other Miscellaneous Stipulations 

More than three (3) unexcused absences from lectures or lab time will automatically render your participation grade (which accounts for 15% of your total grade) as zero (0). More than seven unexcused absences will automatically trigger failure of the class.

Given that a large component of the class is structured around your blog post responses and critiques, I will offer feedback regularly in the form of posting comments to your blog entries. It is recommended but in no way mandated that you use WordPress or Tumblr to host your blog; whatever platform or site architecture you choose, just make sure I and classmates can access it and post meaningful comments. If a blog post is deemed to lack sufficient evidence of having read the text, and thus not deserving of serious critical commentary, I will instead email you with feedback privately.

As previously mentioned, in-lab tutorial assignments should be submitted via email, and all blog post responses and critiques will be submitted by posting them directly to your blog (I will begin checking for posts at 8 a.m., so altering the published time on posts won't work if late—but nice try!). Any work submitted past the stated deadline will at most receive a fifty (50) score and may receive as low as zero (0) at the discretion of the instructor.

Because this course will focus heavily on ensuring all or mostly all produced data visualizations adapt to a variety of different screen sizes, the use of mobile phones in class will be permitted as a prototyping tool (that said, please respect the class time of your peers and do not text or refresh social media accounts ad nauseum; *doing so will result in an automatic deduction of twenty (20) points from your participation score*). You are welcome to bring your own laptop to class or to use the lab computers. If bringing your own machine, please either ensure it is running the Mac OS X operating system, or that you can follow along using the operating system you have without falling behind. We will be using MacOSX Sierra for purposes of in-class tutorials, along with Sublime Text (free; [sublimetext.com](http://sublimetext.com/)), iTerm2 (free; [iterm2.com](http://iterm2.com/)),  Cyberduck (free; [Cyberduck.io](http://cyberduck.io/)) and Tableau Public (free; [http://public.tableau.com](http://public.tableau.com/)). You'll also want to create a Google account in the incredibly rare event you don't already have one, as we'll be using [Google Sheets ](http://sheets.google.com/)for most spreadsheet-related data analysis. 

## VII. Academic Integrity

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the UF Code of Academic Integrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. 

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a flash drive or a hard copy.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero (0) for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

## VII. Course Schedule and Format

This course is inherently interdisciplinary, combining elements of design, statistics, computer science, human-computer interaction and communication studies. But it is still, at its core, a *journalism* course in the sense that its key aim is to help students learn how to distill complex information of public or societal importance into a cogent and engaging narrative for audiences/users. In that regard, then, the course schedule or reading assignments may be subject to change in the event of a major data-rich news event, the publication of a relevant piece of scholarship that contributes to the flow of class discussion or the release of a new technology that expands the possibilities of individual or group projects. This schedule will be embedded as a Google Sheet into the course website to reflect any changes made, and in the event any changes do occur, I will notify the class immediately via email.
