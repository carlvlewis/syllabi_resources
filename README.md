+ **6 April 2015**: Adding syllabi for "The Art and Science of Data-Driven Journalism" and "Making the Business of Digital Journalism Work" into directory `syllabi.` Also adding "Appendix A" (`appendices/reference_list.html`), which contains direct contact information for additional references not listed in my [CV](http://cv.carlvlewis.net) or homepage.
