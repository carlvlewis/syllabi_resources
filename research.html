<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

<p>The following document provides a brief overview of both my scholarly research interests as well as selected areas of continuing professional journalistic and digital media innovation I would bring to the Herbert School –– each of which, most importantly, would compliment my primary duty as an assistant professor: teaching, mentoring and inspiring students to pursue media innovation and entrepreneurship after graduation.</p>

<h4>I. Data visualization and information design</h4>

<p>As both an experienced practitioner and a regularly active thought-contributor in the areas of data visualization and information design, my research spans various aspects of the emerging field of Big Data, including human-centered design (HCD), distilling multivariate datasets for use on mobile and wearable devices, data visualization ethics and best practices, design thinking, emotional design, and open government data platforms. Following the work of seminal thinkers and academics in the field of information design such as <a href="http://edwardtufte.com">Edward Tufte</a>, to prolific programmers who have rapidly sped up the process of visualizing large datasets such as <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> creator <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike Bostock</a>, my interest in information visualization aims both to be theoretical (Tufte-like) and practical (solving current technical or programmatic problems, much as Bostock has). The latter is where I see myself contributing most as a practitioner. Furthermore, from an educational perspective, more research should be done about how to integrate these forms of computational journalism into higher education’s core curriculum.</p>

<h4>II. “Post-platform” and other emerging journalistic paradigms</h4>

<p>In an era of almost limitless and ever-expanding platforms for mass communications, it’s important to remember that today’s platforms likely will become tomorrow’s printing press, and that ultimately <em>all</em> communications technologies are, ipso facto, ephemeral in nature. In <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/making-case-post-platform-journalism/">previous research</a>, I’ve explored this notion through the lens of the journalist’s self-identification based upon the tools or medium in which he or she specializes. From “print journalist”, to “data journalist”, to “multimedia journalist” and even to “social journalist,” it seems as though the qualifiers that often get placed before the word “journalist” abound in almost cliche numbers. Each of these “types” of journalism typically seek to clarify the platform in which the individual tells the story rather than the content of the story itself. But in an era of information abundance spawned by the democratization of publishing, we’ve seen the rapid rise of almost <em>limitless</em> numbers of platforms that require a range of almost <em>limitless</em> skills. Hence the need for a deeper understanding among young journalists to adapt to the role of what I call the “post-platform” journalist – one not tethered to a particular technology or medium, but rather agile and responsive to the needs of the journalist’s particular audience. Some, like <a href="http://twitter.com/aohaeg">Andrew Haeg</a> of <a href="http://groundsource.co">GroundSource</a>, have dubbed this approach “listening journalism.” Others, namely <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/">Jeff Jarvis</a> at CUNY, have branded it as <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2014/04/26/degree-social-journalism/">“social journalism.”</a>. Whatever you label this model of journalism, even [non-media observers]( and marketers recognize the unquantifiable yet significant value in fostering community engagement and acting as community “social networks.”</p>

<p>As we enter headfirst into what <a href="https://emilybellwether.wordpress.com/">Emily Bell</a> of Columbia’s <a href="http://towcenter.org">Tow Center</a> has called the <em>”post-industrial age of journalism”</em> , other scholars and practitioners have proposed medium-agnostic paradigms to support the journalistic work they do. Such paradigms include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_journalism">collaborative journalism</a>, <a href="http://amazon.com/Precision-Journalism-Reporters-Introduction-Science/dp/0742510883">precision journalism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_journalism">civic journalism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_journalism">advocacy journalism</a>, <a href="http://constructivejournalism.org/">constructive journalism</a>, <a href="http://www.poynter.org/tag/entrepreneurial-journalism/">entrepreneurial journalism</a>, <a href="http://towcenter.org/the-art-and-science-of-data-driven-journalism/">data journalism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_journalism">open-source journalism</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_journalism">social journalism</a>, just to name a few. Exploring the inherently human need to self-identify that accompanies these new journalistic paradigms – as well as the difficulties of tethering one’s job title’s to a single medium – is an area of research deserving of scholarly attention.</p>

<h4>III. Digital security and source protection</h4>

<p>In today’s post-Snowden media landscape, it has become of paramount importance for journalists to have the ability to protect their sources’ identities when communicating digitally. Whistleblowers <em>must</em> be afforded the privacy traditionally bestowed upon them as part of the Fourth Estate. But the rapid advance in surveillance technologies from government entities such as the NSA threaten to tear away that fundamental right of journalists that has been consistently upheld by American and European courts in recent decades.</p>

<h4>IV. Funding journalism in a post-advertising era</h4>

<p>Funding digital journalism in the mobile and increasingly wearable age of communications –– particularly at the local and state levels –– is critical to having an informed and engaged citizenry. I tend to espouse a <strong>constructivist</strong> approach to discovering sustainable funding sources for local news coverage in the post-advertising era – likely through some combination of consumer “membership” revenue, collaborations with institutions such as Universities and libraries, foundational support, and even legislation setting aside public subsidies. Furthermore, developing more sophisticated ”impact metrics” and exploring the perils of a single-metric (i.e., page views) system rank high among my interests as a media scholar. Clickbait and slideshows plug a temporary hole to gain cheap ad impressions and generate marginal digital revenue, but ultimately devalue credibility and usability to a level of net loss over time.</p>

<h4>V. Digital Diversity and Unnecessary Barriers to Entry</h4>

<p>Producing the level of interactive journalism required to succeed in tomorrow’s digital media landscape involves overcoming an unnecessarily steep learning-curve, and habving a high level of existing programmatic knowledge that few undergraduate students possess. While an ever-expanding range of <a href="https://pinterest.com/journalismtools">tools</a> have proliferated to democratize certain common storytelling technologies, much of the development process of interactive storytelling, particularly in local development environments, still requires arcane, OS-specific knowledge that students will find difficult if they don’t have an existing network of people to ask. This in turn acts as an artificial barrier to entry for young journalists wishing to acquire programming skills. <em>Anyone actually claiming to seek more diversity in the areas of journalism — and particularly in programming — should research methods to make it easier for these skills to be taught both in the classroom and via digital tutorials.</em></p>

<h4>CONCLUDING</h4>

<p>Together, I seek to employ an interdisciplinary approach to communications studies that spans the disciplines of statistics, computer science, digital humanities, service-learning, interaction design, mobile development, legacy-era journalism practices, urbanism, data science and emerging storytelling paradigms. The logic behind such a holistic approach to communications research is patent: <em>Digital literacy and user engagement are of paramount interest not only to journalists, but to professionals in almost all disciplines.</em> In that sense, I believe every Liberal Arts student should have a digital and/or media literacy course requirement, regardless of their course of study..</p>
